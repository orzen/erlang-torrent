# ertorrent

This is currently an early stage development project of an open
source torrent client written in erlang.

## Build instructions

We use rebar to build the project.

    $ rebar3 compile

For development, we recommend to build and get an interactive erlang shell with:

    $ rebar3 shell --config=config/sys.config

You can run the tests with:

    $ rebar3 eunit
